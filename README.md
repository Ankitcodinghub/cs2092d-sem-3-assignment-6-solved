<u>QUESTIONS </u>

<ol>
<li>A SINGLY LINKED LIST L is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order. Each node of a SINGLY LINKED LIST L is an object with an attribute key and one pointer attribute, next. Given a node x in the list, x.next points to its successor in the linked list. An attribute L.head points to the first node of the list.</li>
</ol>
Write a menu driven program to implement an unsorted SINGLY LINKED LIST L. Your program must contain the following functions:

(In the function prototypes, L, k, x and y denote a Singly Linked List, an integer and nodes of L respectively. All operations should be done in a single pass and all keys are distinct).

<ul>
<li>MAIN() â€“ repeatedly reads a character cfâ€™, ctâ€™, caâ€™, cbâ€™, cdâ€™, ciâ€™, clâ€™, csâ€™ or ceâ€™ from the terminal and calls the sub-functions appropriately until character ceâ€™ is entered.</li>
<li>CREATE-NODE(k) â€“ creates a new node with key k and pointer next of node points to This procedure returns a pointer to the new node.</li>
<li>LIST-INSERT-FRONT(L, x) â€“ inserts x to the front of L.</li>
<li>LIST-INSERT-TAIL(L,x) â€“ inserts x as the last node of L.</li>
<li>LIST-INSERT-AFTER(L, x, y) â€“ inserts the node x after the node y in L. Hint: First invoke LIST-SEARCH() function to locate the node y.</li>
<li>LIST-INSERT-BEFORE(L, x, y) â€“ inserts the node x before the node y in L. Hint: Insertion of a node x before a node y can be done by locally storing a pointer to the current node before moving to the next node.</li>
<li>LIST-DELETE(L, x) â€“ deletes the node x from L. Hint: First invoke LIST-SEARCH() function to locate the node x.</li>
<li>LIST-DELETE-FIRST(L) â€“ deletes the first node from L.</li>
<li>LIST-DELETE-LAST(L) â€“ deletes the last node from L.</li>
<li>LIST-SEARCH(L, k) â€“ searches for a node with key k in L by doing a simple linear search, and if found, returns a pointer to this node. If a node with key k is not present in the list, or if the list is empty, the procedure returns NIL.</li>
</ul>
Note:- For every INSERT operation, the node x is created by calling CREATE-NODE() function. Input format:

<ul>
<li>Each line contains a character from cfâ€™, ctâ€™, caâ€™, cbâ€™, cdâ€™, ciâ€™, clâ€™, csâ€™ or ceâ€™ followed by zero, one or two integers. The integers, if given, are in the range [âˆ’10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>].</li>
<li>Character cfâ€™ is followed by an integer separated by space. In this operation, the node with this integer as key is inserted to the front of L.</li>
<li>Character ctâ€™ is followed by an integer separated by space. In this operation, the node with this integer as key is inserted to the tail of L.</li>
<li>Character caâ€™ is followed by two integers separated by space. In this operation, the node with the first integer as key is inserted after the node with second integer as key.</li>
<li>Character cbâ€™ is followed by two integers separated by space. In this operation, the node with the first integer as key is inserted before the node with second integer as key.</li>
<li>Character cdâ€™ is followed by an integer separated by space. In this operation, the node with this integer as key is deleted from L and the deleted nodeâ€™s key is printed.</li>
<li>Character ciâ€™ is to delete the first node from L and print the deleted nodeâ€™s key.</li>
<li>Character clâ€™ is to delete the last node from L and print the deleted nodeâ€™s key.</li>
<li>Character â€˜sâ€™ is followed by an integer separated by space. This operation is to find the node with this integer as key in L.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>Character â€˜eâ€™ is to â€˜exitâ€™ from the program.</li>
</ul>
Output Format:

<ul>
<li>The output (if any) of each command should be printed on a separate line.</li>
<li>For options â€˜dâ€™, â€˜iâ€™ and â€˜lâ€™ , print the deleted nodeâ€™s key. If a node with the input key is not present in L or L is empty, then print â€”1.</li>
<li>For option â€˜sâ€™, if the key is present in L, then print 1. If key is not present in L or L is empty, then print â€”1.</li>

<ol start="3">
<li>Operating Systems maintain a data structure called Process Control Block(PCB) for each process. The PCB of a process contains information related to that process. For simplicity, we assume that only process id and state of a process are stored in itâ€™s PCB and the process ids are distinct. A process can be in any one of the following states: â€˜newâ€™, â€˜readyâ€™, â€˜runningâ€™, â€˜waitingâ€™, or â€˜terminatedâ€™.</li>
</ol>
Write a menu driven program to maintain PCBs of different processes as a SINGLY LINKED LIST called PCB List L. Each PCB of a PCB List L is an object which stores the attributes of a process in the order process id and state. Your program must contain the following functions: (In function prototypes, L, k and x denote the PCB List, an integer and a node of L respectively).

<ul>
<li>MAIN() â€“ repeatedly reads a character â€˜iâ€™, â€˜dâ€™, â€˜gâ€™, â€˜lâ€™, â€˜uâ€™ or â€˜eâ€™ from terminal and calls the sub-functions appropriately until character â€˜eâ€™ is entered.</li>
<li>CREATE-PCB(k)- Creates a new PCB node with key k and the pointer next of PCB node points to NULL. This procedure returns a pointer to the new PCB node.</li>
<li>INSERT(L, x) â€“ inserts x to the front of L.</li>
<li>DELETE(L, x) â€“ deletes x from L.</li>
<li>GET-STATE(k, L) â€“ returns the state of process with process id=k in L.</li>
<li>LIST-WAITING-PROCESSES(L) â€“ lists the process ids of all processes that are in the state â€˜waitingâ€™ in L.</li>
<li>UPDATE-STATE(L, k, s) â€“ change the state of a PCB with process id=k to s.</li>
<li>LIST-SEARCH(L, k) â€“ does a linear search to find the PCB with process id = k in L, and if found, returns a pointer to the located PCB. If such a PCB is not found, or if the list is empty, then the procedure returns NIL.</li>
</ul>
Note:- For INSERT operation, the PCB x is created by calling CREATE-PCB() function. Input format:

<ul>
<li>Each line contains a character from â€˜iâ€™, â€˜dâ€™, â€˜gâ€™, â€˜lâ€™, â€˜uâ€™, â€˜eâ€™ followed by at most one integer and/or a string. The integers, if given, are in the range [1, 10<sup>6</sup>] and the string is from the set {new, ready, waiting, running, terminated}.</li>
<li>Character â€˜iâ€™ is followed by an integer and a string separated by space. In this operation, the

PCB with the integer as process id and the string as state is inserted into the front of L.</li>
<li>Character â€˜dâ€™ is followed by an integer separated by space. In this operation, the PCB with this integer as process id is deleted from L and the deleted PCBâ€™s process id is printed (you should first invoke a LIST-SEARCH function to locate the node x with the given process id and pass the pointer to node x to DELETE function).</li>
<li>Character â€˜gâ€™ is followed by an integer separated by space. In this operation, the state of PCB with this integer as process id is printed.</li>
<li>Character â€˜lâ€™ is to print the process ids of all PCBs having the state as â€˜waitingâ€™.</li>
<li>Character â€˜uâ€™ followed by an integer k and a string s is to update the state of a PCB with process id=k to the state s.</li>
<li>Character â€˜eâ€™ is to exit from the program.</li>
</ul>
Output Format:

<ul>
<li>The output (if any) of each command should be printed on a separate line.</li>
<li>For option â€˜dâ€™, print the deleted PCBâ€™s process id. If PCB with the given process id is not present in L or if L is empty, then print â€”1.</li>
<li>For option â€˜gâ€™, print the state of PCB with process id=k. If PCB with the given process id is not present in L or if L is empty, then print â€”1.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>For option â€˜lâ€™, list the process ids of all PCBs with state = â€˜waitingâ€™ in L, separated by space. If PCB with state = â€˜waitingâ€™ is not present in L, or if L is empty, then print âˆ’1.</li>
